<h3 align="center">Hello! I'm atom1236, but you can call me Atom or Tom.</h3>

**`Intermediate UI/UX Developer | Experienced video editor`**

I'm a indie full-stack developer that is currently specialised in Lua and Python. I usually do most stuff alone, but I do collaborate with people I know sometimes. I'm also working for Union Development. A roblox game development studio that's composed of a few friends working together. Most of my works are privated. However, I do plan to make open-sourced repo in the future.

*(I'm quite amateur when it comes to working in a collaboration environment. I'm also not a native english speaker, so please excuse any grammatical errors I make.)*

- 💻 I'm currently working on nothing at the moment, as I'm focusing on study.
- 🔭 I'm currently learning networking and cybersecurity.
- 💬 Ask me about anything! I would probably answer it.

    <summary><h3>⚛️ A little history of how I started out</h3></summary>
        At the age of 8, I begin taking interests in coding. I see what a well written code can do, and it fascinates me. I wish to also do the same thing. I came to the realisation of how long of a journey this will takes me, and how little I know about this topic. It doesn't deter me one bit though. I begin making (very bad) games on roblox (out of all places lol), which results in me learning Luau as my first ever language. Nowadays, I have made games, discord bots, websites, participated in competitions, and collaborated in many projects. My young self would probably not believe how far I have got. I'm proud of my progress but I won't stop here.

        If I could change the past, I wouldn't change a thing.
